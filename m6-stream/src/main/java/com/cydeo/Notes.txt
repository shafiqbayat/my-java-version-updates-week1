flatMap() vs map()


map() : takes Stream<T> as input and returns Stream<R>

It is mapper function produces single value for each input value. It is called One-To-One mapping.


flatMap() takes Stream<Stream<T>> as an input and return Stream<R>. It is called One-To-Many mapping


Stream.of(1,2,3,4)  -> [1,2,3,4]

[ [1,2], [3,4] , [5,6], [7,8] ] -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] flatMap()
